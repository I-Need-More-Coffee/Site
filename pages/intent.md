# Intent Statement

*<small>For more information on intent statements, <a href="/knowledge-system-intent-statement">read my post on the matter</a>.</small>*

This website's intent is to be a "final destination" for crystallized and refined knowledge and opinions, as well as a starting point from which users can explore my other sites. It's intended to be a significant body of evergreen work that's easily shareable.

#### This site's place in my information workflow:

##### Opinions and Concepts

Opinions and concepts will usually start out in my [public garden](https://cst.ineedmore.coffee). If inspiration hits to write about a particular subject in a longer, more crystallized form, I'll synthesize information [brewed notes](https://cst.ineedmore.coffee/brewed) into a draft in my private [Anytype](https://anytype.io), and then publish here.

##### Project Posts

Projects will generally start out in my private [Anytype](https://anytype.io), as that's where I store my working documents. Once the project is complete, I'll then synthesize the information privately into a draft (also in Anytype) before later publishing here.

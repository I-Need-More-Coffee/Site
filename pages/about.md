# About `bliss`

bliss is a moderately minimal blog generator, with a build script below 100 lines of shell. It's forked from Bradley Taunt's [barf](https://git.sr.ht/~bt/barf), and keeps things mostly the same while adding in a few little creature comforts for my own use.


## Why?

Bradley described his motivations as follows, and I definitely identify with his thoughts here: 

> This project was created by me, [Bradley Taunt](https://bt.ht), out of frustration with overly complex and bloated blogging options. I tried *so many* "minimal" generators but each one ended up having some glaring issue or heavy reliance on dependencies. 
> 
> I wanted to have a system that I could easily replicate on any Linux machine. Something that didn't require me to download half the internet just to get up and running. I'm a sucker for keeping things simple.

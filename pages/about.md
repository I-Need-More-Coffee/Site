# About Me

![](../public/images/about/me.png)

 I'm **Sohal**, an **undergrad Computer Science student** and **technology enthusiast** who's passionate about **open source software**, **Unix-like operating systems**, **technology's role in education**, **technology repair and sustainability**, and **odd hardware** from the early 2010s.

 I grew up in the hotbed of innovation that is **Northern Virginia**, and currently am a student at the **University of Florida**. Academically, I have yet to narrow down what I want to do, but I'm interested in the **intersection of technology and education**, **cybersecurity** (particularly blue team), and **desktop application development**.

I'm an **innately curious person**, and often find myself doing deep delves into the oddest of topics, from [high-end mechanical pencils](https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/) to [pubnixes](https://tildeverse.org/). While I may not become an enthusiast in any of these interests, they leave a small mark on my life and give me a greater appreciation for the world around me. 

If you want to read more about the **devices**, **software**, and **other things I use** on a daily basis, be sure to read the [Uses](/uses) page.

**I hope you have fun reading my ramblings, and maybe even come away with some useful information or inspiration to do something new!**

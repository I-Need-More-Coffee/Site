## Images

The images on this site are [dithered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) to reduce page size and bandwidth usage. Images take up most of the bandwidth when loading a page, and by dithering them, a page's size can be reduced tenfold while keeping fun visuals and adding a unique aesthetic.

I decided to use dithered images for this site to ensure a quick page loads, add a fun visual identity, and reduce resource and bandwidth usage in the event that I move to locally hosting this site.

The images on this site are currently dithered using **Bayer Ordered Dithering**, in **black and white**, with images shrunk to 512px or 256px wide depending on the amount of detail necessary.

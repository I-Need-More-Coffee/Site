## Images

The images on this site are [dithered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) to reduce page size and bandwidth usage. Images take up most of the bandwidth when loading a page, and by dithering them, a page's size can be reduced tenfold while keeping fun visuals and adding a unique aesthetic.

I decided to use dithered images for this site to ensure a quick page loads, add a fun visual identity, and reduce resource and bandwidth usage in the event that I move to locally hosting this site.

The images on this site are currently dithered using **Bayer Ordered Dithering**, in **black and white**, with images shrunk to 512px or 256px wide depending on the amount of detail necessary.

## Intent

*<small>For more information on intent statements, <a href="/knowledge-system-intent-statement">read my post on the matter</a>.</small>*

This website's intent is to be a "final destination" for crystallized and refined knowledge and opinions, as well as a starting point from which users can explore my other sites. It's intended to be a significant body of evergreen work that's easily shareable.

### This site's place in my information workflow:

#### Opinions and Concepts

Opinions and concepts will usually start out in my [public garden](https://cst.ineedmore.coffee) (*note: this is currently not used and needs an overhaul*). If inspiration hits to write about a particular subject in a longer, more crystallized form, I'll synthesize information [brewed notes](https://cst.ineedmore.coffee/brewed) into a draft in my private notes system (currently an [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) vault), and then publish here.

#### Project Posts

Projects will generally start out in my private notes system, as that's where I store my working documents. Once the project is complete, I'll then synthesize the information privately into a draft (also in my private notes) before later publishing here.

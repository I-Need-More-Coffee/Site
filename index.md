# I Need More Coffee
**Written by Sohal Sudheer**

I'm Sohal, an undergrad cybersecurity student and technology enthusiast who's passionate about open source software, Unix-like operating systems, technology's role in education, technology repair and sustainability, and odd hardware from the early 2010s.

*I Need More Coffee* serves as a place for me to ["just put stuff out there"](https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there), and host a wide variety of content, from deep delves into odd corners of the internet to overviews of the latest piece of strange hardware that's made it's way into my hands. This site is also my [worry stone](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/let-a-website-be-a-worry-stone/), so expect it to morph, change, grow, and sometimes break.

I hope you enjoy reading some of my ramblings below :)

# I Need More Coffee
### Written by Sohal Sudheer

I'm Sohal, an undergrad Computer Science student and technology enthusiast who's passionate about open source software, Unix-like operating systems, technology's role in education, technology repair and sustainability, and odd hardware from the early 2010s.

*I Need More Coffee* serves as a place for me to ["just put stuff out there"](https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there), and host a wide variety of content, from deep delves into odd corners of the internet to overviews of the latest piece of strange hardware that's made it's way into my hands. 

I hope you enjoy reading some of my ramblings below :)

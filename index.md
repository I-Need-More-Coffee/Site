# bliss

**Bl**og **i**t **s**imple, **s**tupid!

`bliss` is a moderately minimal blog generator, with a build script below 100 lines of shell. It's forked from Bradley Taunt's [barf](https://git.sr.ht/~bt/barf), and keeps things mostly the same while adding in a few little creature comforts for my own use.

You can learn more by reading the [README](https://github.com/sohalsdr/bliss).

You can also view the generated [Atom feed here](./atom.xml)

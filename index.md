# I Need More Coffee
### Written by Sohal Sudheer

I'm Sohal, an undergrad Computer Science student and technology enthusiast who's passionate about open source software, Unix-like operating systems, technology's role in education, technology repair and sustainability, and odd hardware from the early 2010s.

*I Need More Coffee* serves as a place for me to ["just put stuff out there"](https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there), and host a wide variety of content, from deep delves into odd corners of the internet to overviews of the latest piece of strange hardware that's made it's way into my hands. 

I'm also participating in **[100 Days to Offload](https://100daystooffload.com/)** until **April 3rd, 2023**, and have posted `002/100` times.

I hope you enjoy reading some of my ramblings below :)

## Summary

This was one of the first devices I've ever owned, getting it as a gift in the 3rd grade. While it ended up becoming the "family iPad" for a while, and then my little brother's, it has found it's way back into my hands and has become a device that I use on a daily basis. Despite it's age the battery has held up extraordinarily well (on average with light usage I charge it maybe once a weeek), and even though it's not Retina the screen still has great viewing angles, color, brightness, and the resolution is good enough for my use-case. I primarily use it for reading PDFs, but I can also get articles to it via an old version of Instapaper, and I also use it to play some older games like Angry Birds Space.

## Notes

- Great battery for it's age.
- Solid screen, people bash it for not being Retina but its still certainly a decent experience
- Just incredible fit and finish, it really holds up relative to modern devices. Pretty thin and portable too, especially in a Smart Cover.
- I found an official Smart Cover as new old stock in a thrift store, it looks incredibly clean and is surprisingly sufficient for protecting the tablet, but does have a habit of coming off inside my backpack.


## Software Notes

### iOS 6.3.1, January 2023 - Present

Apple screwed over A5 devices with the update to iOS 9. I used [iOS-OTA-Downgrader](https://github.com/LukeZGD/iOS-OTA-Downgrader) to downgrade this device to iOS 6, making it a much more pleasant experience (and oddly enough giving me a wider selection of apps to choose from due to various efforts to preserve archives of iOS 2-6 apps). I hope to write a comprehensive post soon detailing how to revive devices like this.

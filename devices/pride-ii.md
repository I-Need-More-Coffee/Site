## Summary

It's the latest iPhone at the time of writing, so there isn't really much I can say that hasn't been said 10,000 times on the internet already. It's an incredibly hefty device, but feels solid. My only concern about this phone is it's (lack of) repairability.

## Notes

None so far.

## Software Notes

### iOS 16, September 2022 - Present

No notes to speak of, I keep my iOS installs pretty vanilla as of late.

## Summary

*Impenitence* has been my main laptop since 2022, and while it has it's quirks, I love it. It's rare for Linux-specific laptops to show up on local used markets like Craigslist, so when I saw this machine for below $500 (I paid even less, as the seller was willing to sell it to me without the RAM, and I had an identical stick on hand), I simply had to jump on it. When I left for college in the fall of 2022, I had to leave my gaming desktop behind, so I opted to loan that to my brother instead and begin using this machine as my primary laptop.

It has a gorgeous screen, decent enough keyboard, and performs exceptionally for everything I need to do. My one gripe with it is that the fan control hasn't been the greatest. Switching from Pop OS! to Fedora has massively improved this for whatever reason, but under moderate load the fans will still very quickly shift from silent to full blast. The thermal performance is simply quite poor with this machine, and I may have to look at reapplying thermal paste to see if it'll help.

## Notes

- This laptop is based on the [Clevo NS50MU](https://laptopwithlinux.com/product/clevo-ns50mu/), but with modified firmware.
- The back logo is a sticker and can peel. System76 support was great and sent me a replacement sticker when mine peeled as I like how the unique brand of laptop is a conversation starter.
- Pretty decent keyboard and superb trackpad, it's a pleasant experience input-wise.
- Definitely a very wide laptop, can be difficult to use on lap or in general while traveling.
- This thing actually has support for facial recognition using [howdy](https://github.com/boltgolt/howdy)!
- Gets very warm and doesn't manage thermals well, often getting hot and ramping up fans. Unsure how much of this can be attributed to the swelling battery (see next note).
- **Found that battery was starting to swell in Spring 2023, had to remove the battery but have yet to find a replacement, meaning that this machine is out of commission as a laptop for now :(.**

## Software Notes

### Fedora Silverblue, Spring 2023 to Present

I currently have it running [Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/) (with Arch containers installed using [Distrobox](https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox) for programming). Though running an immutable system has it's oddities, it has forced me to get more methodical about managing my system, and combined with the leaps that GNOME has made with it's recent 4x releases, has given me a very rock-solid and modern feeling experience.

## Summary

This laptop is a pretty solid but not very performant machine. It's built somewhat rugged, as it's an education-spec device intended for use in classrooms. It gets great battery life, I've been able to stretch it to 12 hours at times, and that's coming from a device that was (ab)used in a school system for presumably years and then left to sit in a warehouse for a while. It also makes for a great test machine, as the hardware is so simple and generic that almost anything runs out of the box without any extra drivers or configuration needed. It's only drawbacks are the somewhat poor performance, the fact that it only has one DIMM slot, and the lackluster screen resolution and keyboard feel.

## Notes

- Flawless Linux compatibility, it has very simple hardware and there's great software support.
- I've been told that this model has also proved to work well with ChromeOS Flex.
- The laptop is intended for an education market, so it has all of the goodies like Dell's relatively feature-packed enterprise BIOS, it's easy to open up and repair, and Dell provides a surprising amount of documentation on how to swap out various components.
- Has pretty good battery life from what I've experienced so far on my unit, have achieved 12+ hours which is great for a laptop approaching 5 years old.

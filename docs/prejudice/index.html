<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This was one of the first devices I've ever owned, getting it as a gift in the 3rd grade. While it ended up becoming the "family iPad" for a while, and then my little brother's, it has found it's way back into my hands and has become a device that I use on a daily basis. Despite it's age the battery has held up extraordinarily well (on average with light usage I charge it maybe once a weeek), and even though it's not Retina the screen still has great viewing angles, color, brightness, and the resolution is good enough for my use-case. I primarily use it for reading PDFs, but I can also get articles to it via an old version of Instapaper, and I also use it to play some older games like Angry Birds Space.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Apple screwed over A5 devices with the update to iOS 9. I used <a href="https://github.com/LukeZGD/iOS-OTA-Downgrader">iOS-OTA-Downgrader</a> to downgrade this device to iOS 6, making it a much more pleasant experience (and oddly enough giving me a wider selection of apps to choose from due to various efforts to preserve archives of iOS 2-6 apps). I hope to write a comprehensive post soon detailing how to revive devices like this.</li>

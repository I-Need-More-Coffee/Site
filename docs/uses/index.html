<h1>Stuff I use</h1>
<p><strong>Updated 2023-04-24</strong></p>
<p>I always love seeing the technology, software, workflows and anything else that people use on a daily bases. I find that it points me towards new things to use in my own life that are tried and tested, as well as giving me a window into the way that person accomplishes their day-to-day activities.</p>
<h2>Devices</h2>
<p><em>Make sure to check out the <a href="/devices">devices page</a> for summaries and notes on a number of devices I've owned or used!</em></p>
<h3>Primary Laptop(s)</h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/devices/sloth.png" alt="Latitude 3380 from the front" /></p>
<p><a href="../sloth">Sloth</a>, my Dell Latitude 3380</p>
<p><img src="../public/images/devices/impenitence.png" alt="System76 Darter Pro Laptop from the front" /></p>
<p><a href="../impenitence">Impenitence</a>, my System76 Darter Pro <em>(It's battery failed recently, so out of commission as a laptop for the time being)</em></p>
<h3>Sacrificial Windows Machine</h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/devices/vanity.png" alt="HP Pavilion x360 from the front right, folded into tent mode" /></p>
<p><a href="../vanity">Vanity</a>, my HP Pavilion 13 x360</p>
<h3>Phone</h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/devices/pride2.png" alt="iPhone 14 Pro from the front" /></p>
<p><a href="../pride-ii">Pride II</a>, my iPhone 14 Pro</p>
<h3>Tablet</h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/devices/prejudice.png" alt="iPad 2 from the front" /></p>
<p><a href="../prejudice">Prejudice</a>, my iPad 2</p>
<h2>Stationery</h2>
<h3>Go-to Pen: <a href="https://www.pilotpen.us/brands/g2/">The Pilot G2</a></h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/uses/g2.png" alt="Pilot G2 Pen" /></p>
<p>I can't overstate my strongly-held opinions on the Pilot G2. For me, it's a pen that just works, and has the best writing feel out of anything I've tried.</p>
<h2>Peripherals</h2>
<h3>Mouse: <a href="https://www.razer.com/gaming-mice/razer-viper-mini">Razer Viper Mini</a></h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/uses/viper.png" alt="Razer Viper Mini mouse from above" /></p>
<p>By all factors, I'd say the Razer Viper Mini is the perfect gaming mouse (for me). It's light enough, a great size, a shape that's very pleasant to hold, and only $30 to boot. What more could you ask for?</p>
<h3>Keyboard: <a href="https://www.keychron.com/pages/keychron-k3-wireless-mechanical-keyboard">Keychron K3</a></h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/uses/keychron.png" alt="Keychron K3 keyboard from above" /></p>
<p>I love this keyboard. It's a really nice blend of form and function, and I personally feel that the low profile Gateron Brown switches are the sweet spot in terms of tactility and travel. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to use it as much as I like recently now that I primarily use a laptop out and about, but my fingers certainly wish they were typing on the Keychron right now.</p>
<h3>Headphones: <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP811?locale=en_US">Airpods Pro</a></h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/uses/airpods.png" alt="Airpods Pro in a case" /></p>
<p>The ability to cancel out noise or add in extra noise with my earbuds on demand has changed my game as a college student and traveler. I'd classify them as essential.</p>
<h2>Footwear</h2>
<h3>Outdooring Boots: <a href="https://www.timberland.com/shop/mens-chocorua-waterproof-hiking-boots-brown-tan-15130214">Timberland Chocorua Hiking Boots, Medium Brown</a></h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/uses/timbies.png" alt="Timberland Chocorua Hiking Boots" /></p>
<p>These boots can handle anything, and are extremely comfy. I've had them for over 3 years now, and they're just as sturdy as ever. I've added some snazzy orange laces for an extra bit of flair.</p>
<h3>Sneakers: <a href="https://www.brooksrunning.com/en_us/adrenaline-gts-22-mens-supportive-road-running-shoe/110366.html">Brooks Running Adrenaline GTS 22, Alloy</a></h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/uses/brooks.png" alt="Brooks Adrenaline sneakers" /></p>
<p>These are the first running shoes I've bought that I can actually run (I'm flat footed and need a decent amount of support from my shoes). They unfortunately seem to be (not so) slowly wearing down.</p>
<h3>Everyday Boots: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211028200216/https://www.timberland.com/shop/mens-port-union-waterproof-insulated-boots-brown-tan-a2bsg210">Timberland Port Union Waterproof Insulated Boots, Brown</a></h3>
<p><img src="../public/images/uses/timbies2.png" alt="Timberland Port Union Boots" /></p>
<p>The Port Union is a really classy looking boot, and I was saddened to see it seems to be discontinued. These boots also have a bit of a heel, resulting in a really confident gait when wearing them.</p>

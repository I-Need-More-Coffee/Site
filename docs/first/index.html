<h1>A first post</h1>
<p>2023-04-03</p>
<p>A first post is always very difficult to write. This one is definitely more of a placeholder than a grand occasion, and may get deleted later, but a first post it is nonetheless.</p>
<p>I've been putting off getting this blog/&quot;brain dump&quot;/&quot;digital garden&quot; set up for weeks now, so I'm very excited to finally have a place to put some of the article ideas I've had saved in my notes for a long time.</p>
<p>I'd also like to start the <a href="https://100daystooffload.com/">#100DaysToOffload</a> challenge, and I suppose that makes this post the first out of 100.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoy reading as I populate this site over the coming months :)</p>

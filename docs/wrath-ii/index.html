<h2>Summary</h2>
<p><em>Wrath II</em> is my current primary laptop, and I absolutely love it. While I have only had a short time with it as of writing this summary, I can say with confidence that it's everything I dreamed of and more. It has a case, keyboard, and trackpad that can contend with a MacBook, repairability that can contend with an old Thinkpad, and a footprint that can contend with a Chromebook.</p>
<p>I actually managed to snag this machine for $400 as specced, as the previous owner claimed to have a freezing issue that I haven't been able to replicate on Fedora Silverblue. I suspect it may have either been a Windows issue, or a firmware/driver quirk solved by running updates and using a recent Linux kernel. I would have been extremely happy with my purchase even if I paid full price, but I'm happy I was able to save this machine from potentially sitting in a drawer or ending up in a landfill.</p>

<h1>My Devices</h1>
<p><strong>I have a</strong> <strong><em>lot</em></strong> <strong>of devices</strong>. A consequence of growing up in an area with a population of rich tech employees getting rid of devices every couple of years is that I have been able to easily and cheaply get my hands on more computers and electronics than I even know what to do with, and that are just old enough to be undesirable to other people. <strong><em>As I tinker with devices, I intend on gradually populating this page entries on various hardware. If even one person finds information here on a device that they haven't been able to easily find anywhere else on the internet, this page has accomplished it's job</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Note on hostnames:</em></strong> <em>My devices' hostnames are named after various sins and virtues, initially inspired by the villains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a>.</em> <strong><em>Laptops, desktops, and mobile devices are assigned sins, while servers and other headless systems are assigned virtues.</em></strong> <em>Hostnames are assigned, to an extent, based on a machine's purpose, so a device that replaces another (like a new phone), will have the same hostname with an incremented suffix (such as Pride being replaced by Pride II).</em></p>

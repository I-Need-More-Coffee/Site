<h1>Intent Statement</h1>
<p><em><small>For more information on intent statements, <a href="/knowledge-system-intent-statement">read my post on the matter</a>.</small></em></p>
<p>This website's intent is to be a "final destination" for crystallized and refined knowledge and opinions, as well as a starting point from which users can explore my other sites. It's intended to be a significant body of evergreen work that's easily shareable.</p>
<h4>This site's place in my information workflow:</h4>
<h5>Opinions and Concepts</h5>
<p>Opinions and concepts will usually start out in my <a href="https://cst.ineedmore.coffee">public garden</a>. If inspiration hits to write about a particular subject in a longer, more crystallized form, I'll synthesize information <a href="https://cst.ineedmore.coffee/brewed">brewed notes</a> into a draft in my private <a href="https://anytype.io">Anytype</a>, and then publish here.</p>
<h5>Project Posts</h5>
<p>Projects will generally start out in my private <a href="https://anytype.io">Anytype</a>, as that's where I store my working documents. Once the project is complete, I'll then synthesize the information privately into a draft (also in Anytype) before later publishing here.</p>

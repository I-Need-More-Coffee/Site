<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><img src="../public/images/about/me.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>I'm <strong>Sohal</strong>, an <strong>undergrad Cyber Security Engineering student</strong> and <strong>technology enthusiast</strong> who's passionate about <strong>open source software</strong>, <strong>Unix-like operating systems</strong>, <strong>technology's role in education</strong>, <strong>technology repair and sustainability</strong>, and <strong>odd hardware</strong> from the early 2010s.</p>
<p>I grew up in the hotbed of innovation that is <strong>Northern Virginia</strong>, and after spending an amazing in Gainesville, FL at the University of Florida studying Computer Science, I'm back in NoVA studying <strong>Cyber Security Engineering</strong> at <strong>George Mason University</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm an <strong>innately curious person</strong>, and often find myself doing deep delves into the oddest of topics, from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/">high-end mechanical pencils</a> to <a href="https://tildeverse.org/">pubnixes</a>. While I may not become a hardcore enthusiast in any of these interests, they leave a small mark on my life and give me a greater appreciation for the world around me.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about the <strong>devices</strong>, <strong>software</strong>, and <strong>other things I use</strong> on a daily basis, be sure to read the <a href="/uses">Uses</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>I hope you have fun reading my ramblings, and maybe even come away with some useful information or inspiration to do something new!</strong></p>

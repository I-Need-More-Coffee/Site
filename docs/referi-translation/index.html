<h1>Resources for a Resource-Saving Internet</h1>
<p>2023-05-18</p>
<p>A while back, I stumbled upon <a href="https://korayer.de">korayer</a>'s <a href="https://referi.de">RE;FERI</a>. This site outlines a number of resources about creating lightweight websites, and most notably includes the template for a CSS grid system, allowing one to create websites with layouts more complex than just a linear text document, but without any bloated JavaScript. I was intrigued by the possibilities, but didn't want to continue having to view the site in Google Translate, so I created <a href="https://github.com/ineedmore-coffee/referi">my own fork</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../public/images/referi-translation/screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of the grid system on the example site of my version of RE;FERI" /></p>
<h2>Translation</h2>
<p>I don't know German (the language the original version is written in). As a result, I relied on a combination of Google Translate, as well as my own intuition on the message being conveyed. This has resulted in what I feel is a reasonable interpretation, but <strong>please do <a href="https://github.com/ineedmore-coffee/referi/issues/new">open an issue</a> if there's anything I've grossly misinterpreted</strong>.</p>
<h2>Dark Mode</h2>
<p>One aspect of the original RE;FERI that bugged me was the <strong>lack of a dark mode</strong>. In 2023, every website has a dark version, and I knew from my work on <a href="https://github.com/ineedmore-coffee/main/blob/main/header.html">this site</a> that it's <a href="https://bt.ht/html-dark-mode">incredibly easy to add a dark mode to a simple HTML site</a>. As such, <strong>my version of RE;FERI supports a dark mode</strong>. This is achieved using just the <code>&lt;meta name=&quot;color-scheme&quot; content=&quot;dark light&quot;&gt;</code> tag to indicate to the browser that a dark mode is available, and then some mode-specific CSS styling for links, highlights, and some other custom elements to ensure consistent readability across modes.</p>
<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>I think this system, and having a version in English with a dark mode, will allow me to easily create more pages for <em>I Need More Coffee</em>, as well as other personal projects, that preserve the simple, lightweight, and quick-to-load nature of this site. For starters, I plan on using it for the <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/my-verified-online-presence">verification page</a> I discussed in a <a href="https://ineedmore.coffee/some-admin">previous post</a>. <strong>I'm excited to see what I, and others, can create with this.</strong></p>

<h1>Stuff I use</h1>
<p><em>Note: This page is currently a</em> <strong><em>work in progress</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>Updated 2023-04-03</strong></p>
<p>I always love seeing the technology, software, workflows and anything else that people use on a daily bases. I find that it points me towards new things to use in my own life that are tried and tested, as well as giving me a window into the way that person accomplishes their day-to-day activities.</p>
<h2>Devices</h2>
<p>I have a <em>lot</em> of devices. A consequence of growing up in an area with a population of rich tech employees getting rid of devices every couple of years is that I was able to easily and cheaply get my hands on more computers and electronics than I even know what to do with, and that are just old enough to be undesirable to other people.</p>
<p>As a result, this won't be an exhaustive list of devices, but rather a periodically updated summary of my most-used hardware.</p>
<p><strong><em>Note on hostnames:</em></strong> <em>My devices' hostnames are named after various sins and virtues, initially inspired by the villains of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fullmetal_Alchemist:_Brotherhood">Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</a>.</em> <strong><em>Laptops, desktops, and mobile devices are assigned sins, while servers and other headless systems are assigned virtues.</em></strong> <em>Hostnames are assigned, to an extent, based on a machine's purpose, so a device that replaces another (like a new phone), will have the same hostname with an incremented suffix (such as Pride being replaced by Pride II).</em></p>

<em>Impenitence</em> has been my main laptop since 2022, and while it has it's quirks, I love it. It's rare for Linux-specific laptops to show up on local used markets like Craigslist, so when I saw this machine for below $500 (I paid even less, as the seller was willing to sell it to me without the RAM, and I had an identical stick on hand), I simply had to jump on it. When I left for college in the fall of 2022, I had to leave my gaming desktop behind, so I opted to loan that to my brother instead and begin using this machine as my primary laptop.<p>It has a gorgeous screen, decent enough keyboard, and performs exceptionally for everything I need to do. My one gripe with it is that the fan control hasn't been the greatest. Switching from Pop OS! to Fedora has massively improved this for whatever reason, but under moderate load the fans will still very quickly shift from silent to full blast. The thermal performance is simply quite poor with this machine, and I may have to look at reapplying thermal past to see if it'll help.</p>
<p>I currently have it running <a href="https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org/">Fedora Silverblue</a> (with Arch containers installed using <a href="https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox">Distrobox</a> for programming). Though running an immutable system has it's oddities, it has forced me to get more methodical about managing my system, and combined with the leaps that GNOME has made with it's recent 4x releases, has given me a very rock-solid and modern feeling experience.</p>

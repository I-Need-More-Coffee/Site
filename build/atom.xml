		<title>A first post</title>
		<content type="html">&lt;h1&gt;A first post&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2023-04-03&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gainesville, Florida&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A first post is always very difficult to write. This one is definitely more of a placeholder than a grand occasion, and may get deleted later, but a first post it is nonetheless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve been putting off getting this blog/&quot;brain dump&quot;/&quot;digital garden&quot; set up for weeks now, so I&#39;m very excited to finally have a place to put some of the article ideas I&#39;ve had saved in my notes for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d also like to start the &lt;a href=&quot;https://100daystooffload.com/&quot;&gt;#100DaysToOffload&lt;/a&gt; challenge, and I suppose that makes this post 1/100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy reading as I populate this site over the coming months :)&lt;/p&gt;

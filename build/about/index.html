<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><img src="../public/images/about/me.png" alt="" /></p>
<p> I'm <strong>Sohal</strong>, an <strong>undergrad Computer Science student</strong> and <strong>technology enthusiast</strong> who's passionate about <strong>open source software</strong>, <strong>Unix-like operating systems</strong>, <strong>technology's role in education</strong>, <strong>technology repair and sustainability</strong>, and <strong>odd hardware</strong> from the early 2010s.</p>
<p> I grew up in the hotbed of innovation that is <strong>Northern Virginia</strong>, and currently am a student at the <strong>University of Florida</strong>. Academically, I have yet to narrow down what I want to do, but I'm interested in the <strong>intersection of technology and education</strong>, <strong>cybersecurity</strong> (particularly blue team), and <strong>desktop application development</strong>.</p>
<p>I'm an <strong>innately curious person</strong>, and often find myself doing deep delves into the oddest of topics, from <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalpencils/">high-end mechanical pencils</a> to <a href="https://tildeverse.org/">pubnixes</a>. While I may not become an enthusiast in any of these interests, they leave a small mark on my life and give me a greater appreciation for the world around me. </p>
<p>If you want to read more about the <strong>devices</strong>, <strong>software</strong>, and <strong>other things I use</strong> on a daily basis, be sure to read the <a href="/uses">Uses</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>I hope you have fun reading my ramblings, and maybe even come away with some useful information or inspiration to do something new!</strong></p>

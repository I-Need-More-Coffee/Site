# My Dog, Alfie

![](../public/images/alfie.png)

This is an example blog post, solely created as an excuse to display this image of my dog Alfie, and so that there's something in `public` and `rsync` doesn't complain about the folder not existing when building the example site.

### Why does the image look funny?

The image is [dithered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither) using Bayer Ordered Dithering. This creates a pretty distinct "cross-hatched" look, and more importantly cuts image size down massively to make pages more responsive. [Dither it!](https://ditherit.com/) is a great tool to quickly dither images online.

# A first post

2023-04-03

Gainesville, Florida

A first post is always very difficult to write. This one is definitely more of a placeholder than a grand occasion, and may get deleted later, but a first post it is nonetheless.

I've been putting off getting this blog/"brain dump"/"digital garden" set up for weeks now, so I'm very excited to finally have a place to put some of the article ideas I've had saved in my notes for a long time.

I'd also like to start the [#100DaysToOffload](https://100daystooffload.com/) challenge, and I suppose that makes this post 1/100.

I hope you enjoy reading as I populate this site over the coming months :)

## Posting Instructions (for my own reference)

1. Make a new post in `posts/`
	a. Put any images for that post in `public/images/<post-name>`
2. Run `make build` to rebuild the site
3. `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push`

***Note:** In the case of a page build error, you can run steps 2-3 again to trigger a commit that just updates a timestamp in the atom feed and forces Pages to attempt a rebuild.*
